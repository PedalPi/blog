Often is necessary use a physical controller that manages the configurations based on our need. Digital audio equipment generally offers support to [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) protocol. By him, a MIDI controller equipment can manage it.

Pedal Pi offers an alternative to the MIDI. By the [_Pedal Pi component API_](http://pedalpi-application.readthedocs.io/en/latest/controller.html#notification-scope), is possible implements custom controllers using the hardware GPIO pins. Also, adding a GPIO library will be easy use the common electronic components like buttons, switches, and LEDs.

In this article, we will create a simple component for manages the current pedalboard.

## 1. Configuring environment

The initial step is to install the requirements. We will assume that you are using a Raspberry Pi with an updated version of Raspbian OS. If you are not using the Raspbian, you can [download](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) and [install](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) it.

For managing the GPIO in high level, we will use the [GPIO Zero, a friendly Python API for physical computing](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/gpio-zero-a-friendly-python-api-for-physical-computing/) **for Raspberry Pi**. [This library is installed by default in Raspbian](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing.html), but you can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-gpiozero
```

If you haven't installed the Pedal Pi libraries, you can check out the [article that explains how to configure a Pedal Pi machine]({filename}/Building Pedal Pi Raspberry P0.md).

## 2. Testing the buttons

Our first script is a simple _hello world_ like code using a button: Pressing the button, the script prints the classical Hello World in the console. If you haven't familiarity with python, a good choice is checking the [Raspberry Foundation Python Tutorial](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/python/).

Connect the button like this:

![Connection with button and Raspberry Pi - Font: GPIO Zero]({filename}/images/gpiozero-button.png)

And writes the first code:

```python
from gpiozero import Button

button = Button(2)

while True:
    if button.is_pressed:
        print("Button is pressed")
    else:
        print("Button is not pressed")
```

Our goal is _when pressed_ the button **next**, the current pedalboard changes to the next, and _when pressed_ the button **before**, the current pedalboard changes to the before. The current code is not suitable if the user press during two seconds a button, as an example, it will changes the current pedalboard very times! Now we will fix it, printing the message only when the button is pressed.

```python
from gpiozero import Button
from time import sleep

next_button = Button(2)
before_button = Button(3)

def to_next_pedalboard():
    print("Button next is pressed")

def to_before_pedalboard():
    print("Button before is pressed")

next_button.when_pressed = to_next_pedalboard
before_button.when_pressed = to_before_pedalboard

sleep()
```

For more details about the button GPIO Zero API, check [their documentation](http://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/recipes.html#button).

## 3. Controlling the current pedalboard

For changes the current pedalboard, we can use the [**CurrentContoller**](https://github.com/PedalPi/Application/blob/master/application/controller/current_controller.py#L24), a controller for manages the current pedalboard. This class contains some interesting methods, like `to_before_pedalboard` and `to_next_pedalboard` (we need them!).  For other methods, see [the CurrentController docs](http://pedalpi-application.readthedocs.io/en/latest/controller.html#currentcontroller). The following code shows how to obtains the controller by the application.

```python
from application.controller.current_controller import CurrentController

current_controller = application.controller(CurrentContoller)

# ...

next_button.when_pressed = current_controller.to_next_pedalboard
before_button.when_pressed = current_controller.to_before_pedalboard
```

Runs the Pedal Pi (for a while) requires the execution of the main code. It loads the components and initializes the Pedal Pi. We will write a new main code that contains the code to controls the Pedal Pi ðŸ˜Š.

```python
import sys
from signal import pause

from gpiozero import Button
from application.application import Application

application = Application(path_data="data/", address='localhost')

# Code to controls the current pedalboard
from application.controller.current_controller import CurrentController

current_controller = application.controller(CurrentContoller)
next_button = Button(2)
before_button = Button(3)

next_button.when_pressed = current_controller.to_next_pedalboard
before_button.when_pressed = current_controller.to_before_pedalboard

# The code must be before the "start()" calls.
application.start()

try:
    pause()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    application.stop()
```

## 4. Class component

Mixing IHM code with other codes is a problem. Add more functionalities will cause confusing in a moment (hello [Spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code)). We use now Object Orientation for improves our code.

Now that we know how to use buttons in the library GPIO Zero, it's time to learn about components. Component in _Pedal Pi_ is the [way that the _Application module_ allows adding functionalities to Pedal Pi](http://pedalpi-application.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#extending). The functionalities are built, in general, to provides Human Machine Interface (HMI) or to provides an opening for an another software consumes the features. Through a component

Changing the previous code for component support:

```python
# FILE: pedalboard_selector.py
from gpiozero import Button
from application.component.component import Component
from application.controller.current_controller import CurrentController

class PedalboardSelector(Component):

    def __init__(self, application):
        super(RaspberryP0, self).__init__(application)
        current_controller = application.controller(CurrentContoller)
        self.next_button = Button(2)
        self.before_button = Button(3)

        self.next_button.when_pressed = current_controller.to_next_pedalboard
        self.before_button.when_pressed = current_controller.to_before_pedalboard

    def close(self):
        self.next_button.close()
        self.before_button.close()
```

And add support

```python
# FILE: main.py
import sys
from signal import pause

from gpiozero import Button
from application.application import Application
# To import the component created
from pedalboard_selector import PedalboardSelector

application = Application(path_data="data/", address='localhost')
# Add the code
application.register(PedalboardSelector(application))
application.start()

try:
    pause()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    application.stop()
```
